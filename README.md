# Watari
Website Design idea for Watari

This Web design concept has been proposed as a replacement for the current Watari's site, aiming for simplicity and ease of use when filling out form data. By implementing this design, it is intended to prevent users from incorrectly uploading or inputting the required data for the 特定技能 (specific special worker) visa application in Japan. Although it is still a work in progress, I find the process enjoyable.
